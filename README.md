THE ODIN PROJECT LANDING PAGE

Hello! My name is Jessi B., and I am an aspiring web developer. 
This project is an assignment for the Odin Project's HTML & CSS Foundations Course.

My goal with this project is to practice using CSS flexbox tools, which are 
included but not limited to justifying and aligning content, grouping various 
items into div containers, and making things pretty without wreaking layout havoc.

I focused less on responsive design as media queries will be touched on in a later
section of the Odin Project.
